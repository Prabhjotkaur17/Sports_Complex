      <p><span>Raman</span> Football Team Coach </p>
      <p>I wanted to let you know what an inspiration the club has been to my son, Ram. He has grown tremendously as an athlete and team player which I attribute to the phenomenal coaching staff…. One grim Monday morning, he announced that Mondays were no longer so horrible since he knew he had soccer practice to look forward to each week!</p>
